       <b> Where do best ideas come from? The emergence of best ideas in social structures</b>

      </p>
<p>An action chain can be thought of a network of actor-related events that impacted the development trajectory of an idea that itself unfolds on a network of social relations. We identified a single focal action chain to follow in every run of the model. The action chain depicted in this video is from a sample model run where the focal action chain resulted in the best possible idea. In this action chain, an idea gets developed within one network community, and then transferred into a second network community, where it is subsequently recombined with an existing idea and ultimately improved through self-search into the best possible idea. </p>

<p>The chain begins in time period 83 when the brown actor holding an idea with a performance of 4.8 discovers a better idea with performance 7.1 through self-search, and again similarly improves the idea in time period 157 (blue squares). This idea is then copied by an actor from a different network community in in time period 247 (yellow square), and subsequently recombined within that network community in time period 252 (pink square). This recombination results in an a novel idea with performance 4.6. This performance is higher for one of the actors involved (previously performance, 4.3), who adopts it; the other actor does not (previous performance, 7.8). The actor who adopted the recombination improves the idea through self-search in time period 284 and again in time period 683 (blue squares), when it reaches the maximum performance possible of 22.6.</p>

     <p><b>Video: Action Chain on Social Structure.</b> Circles are actors, labeled by  the performance of the idea they currently believe is the best performing idea. Circle color describes the type of the change event in which they last participated (blue = self-search; pink = within-network-community recombination; yellow = between-network-community transfer; brown = initial state; gray = not involved in this activity chain). Squares are change events, labeled by the time period in which it occurred and placed near the actor(s) involved. Square color describes the type of the change event that produced the idea (same color scheme as actors). Links are social ties that determine which actors can interact with whom. To aid visualization, actors remain located together with their network communities (as in Figure 2 in the main text), even though their location in idea space may have changed.</p>
